2023-09-01 - Group Discussion About Slip Rate Database Release
Several important issues have come up that need to be resolved before we can move forward. These are important things to discuss, so I am glad they came up.

What should we name the Slip Rate Database?
Geologic Slip Rate Database
Earthquake Geology Database (but this is just one component)
Something else?
Do we need to avoid acronyms?
Can we/should we change the abstract title for our poster?

What about the Earthquake Geology Data Warehouse idea?
Could be organized like CXM. One homepage, that links to the separate databases.
If yes, who do we list on the right side, and what is their role? Could we leave the right side box off for now?
We could add PBR’s, Chronology Data, and Vertical Motion

Are there remaining issues for the Slip Rate Database homepage?

Are there remaining issues for the Slip Rate Web Tool or User Guide?
What should we call the web tools? Web tool? Viewer? Explorer?
Geologic Slip Rate Database Viewer
Geologic Slip Rate Database Explorer


This applies to various CXM web tools as well (after annual meeting)

Should I keep a unique ID for each site?
This is easy now, but will get more complex as time goes on.
Yes. Call it “Identifier”
